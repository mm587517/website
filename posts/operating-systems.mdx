<Box question="What are the types of concurrent unit control?">
    - Physical Concurrency
    - Logical Concurrency

    <Box question="when do they occurr?">
        - Phyical occurs when two or more processors are running simultaneously
        - Logical happens when execution happens in intervals in a single processor
    </Box>

</Box>

<Box question="How do concurrent processes interact with each other?">
  - shared variables: processes read and write to shared memory - ![Shared

  - message passing: messages are sent through communication channels -
