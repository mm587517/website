## Process Synchronization

### Process

<Box question="What is a process?">
  We can define a process as a program that is currently being executed.
</Box>

<Box question="What are the states of a process?">

    - Ready: ready for execution
    - Running: executing process
    - Blocked: waiting or blocked until another process gives the all clear

</Box>

<Box question="What are the types of concurrent unit control?">
    - Physical Concurrency
    - Logical Concurrency

    <Box question="when do they occurr?">
        - Phyical occurs when two or more processors are running simultaneously
        - Logical happens when execution happens in intervals in a single processor
    </Box>

</Box>

<Box question="How do concurrent processes interact with each other?">
  - shared variables: processes read and write to shared memory 
    - ![Shared Svariables](https://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa14/classes/17-concurrency/figures/shared-memory.png)
  - message passing: messages are sent through communication channels

</Box>

### Critical Sections

<Box question="What is a critical section?">
  Region of code that needs to be executed atomically since resources are shared
</Box>

<Box question="Solution to the critical section problem?">
  - <Box question="Busy Waiting">
      Technique in which a process/task waits and constantly checks for a condition to be satisfied before proceeding with its execution
      ![Busy Waiting](https://www.baeldung.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/08/Busywaiting.svg)
    </Box>
  - <Box question="Disabling Interrupts">
       - The CPU will be unable to switch processes
       - Processes can use shared variables without another process accessing it
    </Box>
  - <Box question="Test-and-Set Intruction">
      - Shared variable is lock which is initialized to false
      - Algorithm returns value that was sent and sets lock to true
      ```c
        boolean lock = false;

        boolean TestAndSet (boolean &target){
            boolean rv = target;
            target = true;
            return rv;
        }

        while(1){
            while (TestAndSet(lock));
            critical section
            lock = false;
            remainder section
        }
      ```
    </Box>
</Box>

### Semaphores

<Box question="What is a semaphore?">
  It is similar to an integer but differs in:
    - value can only be increased or decreased. No reading occurs
    - after decreasing, if the value is negative then the thread is blocked until the semaphore is positive
    - once a thread is released and increases the value of the semaphore, one waiting thread gets accesss
</Box>

<Box question="Does the semaphore have atomic operations?">
  Yes
  - P(S): decrements the value
  - V(S): increments the value 

  ```c
  sem = Semaphore(1)

  // Process
  sem.P()
    // critical section
  sem.V()
  ```
</Box>

<Box question="Why use semaphores?">
  - Solutions are clean
  - Solutions are portable and efficient
</Box>

<Box question="difference between locks, mutex semaphore?">
  - lock allows only one thread to enter the part that's locked and the lock is not shared with any other processes
  - mutex is the same as a lock but it can be system wide
  - semaphore does the same as a mutex but allows x number of threads to enter
</Box>
