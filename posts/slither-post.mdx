# Slither

<br />
In this post I will be summarizing findings from other resources. The group can use
this post as quick stop to quickly access the rest of findings.

<br />
### About

Slither is the [Leading Static Analyzer](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/05/27/slither-the-leading-static-analyzer-for-smart-contracts/)
for Smart Contracts. Here are some of the popular uses:

- Automated vulnerability detection
- Automated optimization detection
- Code Understanding
- Assited code review

<br />
#### How it works:

1. Solidity compiler produces the Solidity Abstract Syntax Tree(AST). Slither then takes this AST as input.
2. Information is generated from the AST, such as the control flow graph
3. Slither translated the code into the SlithIR, an internal representation language, in order to analyze contracts easier.
4. Pre-defined tests are ran to provide information

<br />
### Installation

Slither can be installed using pip. Slither is Python based and
requires Python $\geq 3.6$

```sh
pip3 install --user slither-analyzer
```
