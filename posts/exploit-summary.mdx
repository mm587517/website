My Notes on some of the exploits

## Indexed Attack

- $16m worth of assets were stolen from the indices DEFI5 and CC10

### Automated Makert Makers (AMM)

- Automated decentralized exchange where trades are made against a pool of tokens
- Algorithm regulates the values and prices of the tokens in the liquidity pools
- Example: Uniswap, Curve, and Balancer

### Index Fund

An index fund is a pool of different assets in various ratios or balances.

Traditional Finance:
- portfolio manager manually trades to bring funds back to intended balance

Decentralized Finance:
- the fund rebalances automatically when trade occurs

#### Balancer

Crypto pools function as weighted index fund

Maintain portfolios of up to eight different ERC-20 tokens

Balancer uses its constant mean market maker equation to automatically rebalance assets within pools via algorithm every time a trade is made

Balancer crypto exchange trading fees are paid directly to liquidity providers
